As discussed, here are the useful links I mentioned.  Graeme is investigating a potential way around the copy and paste limitations to save you having to type the URLs in manually.

EquatePlus Home:

•	http://intra.equateplus.net/display/EQPLUS

Jumpboard:

Simple exercise: 

1.	Login in to any company as an admin and create a new participant
2.	View that participant’s Personal Details using the Participant Personal Pages 
3.	As an admin, change some of the participant’s data (e.g. work email address)
4.	Using the Participant Personal Pages, confirm data has been changed successfully
